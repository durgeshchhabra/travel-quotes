Don't listen to what they say go and see.
Man cannot discover new oceans unless  he has the courage to lose sight of the shore.. 
 Remember that happiness a way of travel not a destination.
Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all.
Batter to see something once that hear about it a thousand times..
Take only memories , leave only footprint
Remember that happiness is a way of travel not a destination..
I'm in love with cities I've never been to and people I've never met
